## Weather Data Analysis with Dynamic 2D Arrays in C++

### Overview 🎉
Welcome to **Too Hot Too Cold** – the weather data analysis tool that makes tracking your city's mood swings a blast! Built in C++ using dynamic 2D arrays, this program takes you on a meteorological adventure. Whether you're curious about which day set the city on fire or froze it over, our tool has you covered.

### Features 🌟
- **Dynamic Data Storage:**  
  Effortlessly allocate and manage your daily temperature data for an entire month.

- **In-Depth Temperature Analysis:**  
  - **Hottest & Coldest Day:** Identify the days when the heat was off the charts or the chill was bone-freezing. 🔥❄️  
  - **Monthly Average:** Calculate the overall average temperature for brag-worthy insights.
  - **Trend Detection:** Spot days with rising or falling maximum temperatures and see the weather's mood swings in action.

- **Interactive Input:**  
  Enter the number of days in the month and input each day's minimum and maximum temperatures. The program even calculates the average automatically!

- **User-Friendly Display:**  
  Enjoy a neatly formatted table of your weather data that’s easy on the eyes.

- **Slick Memory Management:**  
  Dynamically allocated memory is properly deallocated – because even our code knows how to keep things cool.

### How It Works 🛠️
1. **Input Data:**  
   - Specify the number of days in the month (28, 30, or 31).
   - Enter minimum and maximum temperatures for each day.
   - The program calculates the average temperature for you.

2. **Process Data:**  
   - Determines the hottest and coldest day.
   - Computes the monthly average temperature.
   - Identifies trends in maximum temperature changes.

3. **Display Results:**  
   - Presents a clear table of temperature data.
   - Outputs insights like the hottest/coldest day and temperature trends.

4. **Memory Cleanup:**  
   - Frees up allocated memory to keep your system as cool as your data.

### Getting Started 🚀
#### Requirements:
- **Compiler:**  
  A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., g++, Visual Studio).

- **Libraries:**  
  Uses standard libraries such as `iostream` and `iomanip` (plus any others you might need).
